# Frank Zappa Tribute Page

---

This page is dedicated to one of my favorite minds I've come across and includes a concise summary of his role as a 20th-century composer. When I bring his name up, the people who recognize him seem to associate his image to a snarly guy with sharp views and crude jokes who wrote crazy music. 

While that is probably true, this dedication page aims to capture an essence of his leadership qualities as a boss, and touch on the impact he had on the musicians he employed.
