            Frank Zappa was a genius composer. He blended orchestral sounds
            with R&B, Blues and Rock & Roll. After spending hours
            writing each part, he gathered musicians to rehearse and
            perform his music. They ran through devations of various parts
            based on hand signals Zappa would later call during a live
            performance. All parts were memorized by each member. If not,
            Frank would find a way to call them out on stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had a way of attracting high caliber musicians with successful
            careers of their own. Ansley Dunbar (Rock drummer) left his own
            television show in England to join the second rendition of
            The Mothers of Invention. George Duke (Jazz keyboard) joined Frank
            for 2 years then went on tour with Cannonball Aderly for 2 years,
            and returned. On a documentary, George said playing with Frank was
            "some of the best years" he had on stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from pulling in talent, Frank shaped many of the alumni whom
            lead successful music careers after working for him. Vinnie Colaiuta,
            Steve Vai, Terry Bozzio, Adrian Belew, and Mike Keneally just to name
            a few. There were also the incredible musicians who were key characters
            that brought the music to life. Ruth Underwood, Bruce & Tom Fowler,
            Napoleon Murphy Brock, Ray White, Tommy Mars and Ed Mann.
          </p>
          <p>
            The journalist hyperfocused on Frank's Rock & Roll attitude, but
            behind the scenes he was a composer with hired musicians. He spent
            thousands of dollars on union musicians in orchestras and was disatisfied
            with the results. Having a medium sized group of versatile, dedicated,
            and hard working musicians enabled him to produce a high volume of content.

            Frank Zappa was a great 21st century composer. He was inspired by Edgard
            Varese, Johnny Guitar Watson, Igor Stravinsky, Spike Jones, cheap monster
            movies and anything that made his brows raise. His unique sonic imprint
            was an accumulation of his life's experiences.
